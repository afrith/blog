These are some personal projects I've worked on lately.

###South African census website

Statistics South Africa doesn't make census data available on the web for the so-called "main places" and "subplaces", which correspond to cities, towns, suburbs and villages. So I developed a website to share some of the basic demographic information about these places. There's [one site for the 2011 census](http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/), and another site (with not so many features) [for the 2001 census](http://census.adrianfrith.com/).

###Census dot-maps

These maps show the racial distribution of the population in South African cities. See [the blog post for more details](http://blog.adrianfrith.com/dot-maps/).

###Election results maps

I developed [a "slippy" interactive web interface for exploring the results of South African elections](http://elections.adrianfrith.com/), all the way down to voting district level. Currently it includes the results of the 2009 and 2014 elections. I have also developed a [dot density map of the 2014 election](http://election-dotmap.adrianfrith.com/) which shows a dot for every vote cast.

###Maps for Wikipedia

I've produced a lot of maps for use on Wikipedia, mostly related to Southern Africa. There's [a category on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Maps_by_Htonl) with everything I've produced.
