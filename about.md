I'm a 20-something gay Capetonian guy. I'm a software developer for the [Democratic Alliance](http://www.da.org.za/), with a focus on handling geographical and statistical data. This is my blog where I write (occasionally) about things that take my interest. Often those involve Linux and/or open-source software and/or stuff related to GIS and geographical data.
