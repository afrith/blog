I'm a 30-something gay Capetonian guy. I'm a software developer by profession, with a particular interest in geographical data and mapping. I currently work as Director of Campaign Technology for the [Democratic Alliance](http://www.da.org.za/). This is my blog where I write (occasionally) about things that take my interest. Often those involve Linux and/or open-source software and/or stuff related to GIS and geographical data.
