title: Dot-maps of racial distribution in South African cities
---

Inspired by Bill Rankin's ["Chicago Boundaries"](http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?chicagodots), and having finally obtained a copy of the small-area data from Census 2011, I decided to draw some similar dot-maps showing how the population is distributed in South African cities. The primary lesson from these is that the legacy of apartheid is still very clearly visible. I suppose that was to be expected.

[**UPDATE:** click here for my new post with comparable maps from the 2001 census.](/dot-maps-2001/)

[**UPDATE 2:** click here for a zoomable, scrollable map of the whole country.](/slippy-dot-map/)

In each map, one dot represents 50 people. Here's Cape Town (with all of these, click for a full-size version):

I've also made maps for <a href="/images/dotmaps/Bloemfontein-2011.png">Bloemfontein</a>, <a href="/images/dotmaps/East-London-2011.png">East London</a>, <a href="/images/dotmaps/Port-Elizabeth-2011.png">Port Elizabeth</a> and <a href="/images/dotmaps/Pretoria-2011.png">Pretoria</a>.
