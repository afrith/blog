title: Some information about South African redditors
---

I took a look at the data from the [Who in the World is reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/who-in-world-is-reddit-results-are-in.html) survey to see what it says about South African redditors. Only 83 survey entries listed their country of residence as South Africa, compared to 409 subscribers to [/r/southafrica](http://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica), so this data might not provide a complete picture.

To start off, it will surprise no-one to learn that most SA redditors are men in their twenties and thirties.

Despite the “forever alone” stereotype, just about half are in a relationship.

We’re a pretty well-educated lot, with almost two-thirds having some type of degree. I’m a little curious about the one associate’s degree, since I don’t think such a thing exists in South Africa. Could be an American expat, I suppose.

Income has quite a varied distribution. The original income ranges are given in multiples of US$20 000 — for the sake of having relatively round numbers, I used an exchange rate of seven rand to the dollar.

(And yes, I know this is a bad histogram, but it seems to be impossible to get Libreoffice Calc to draw a better one.)

I didn’t draw a chart of the answers to the “favourite subreddit” question, because the answers were widely varying. The top seven were:

* /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu: 8 people
* /r/askreddit: 7 people
* /r/pics: 4 people
* /r/truereddit: 4 people
* /r/askscience: 3 people
* /r/iama: 3 people
* /r/programming: 3 people

(I counted “f7u12” responses towards fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.)

Finally, there are the two really serious questions. It turns out that South African redditors are mostly dog people:

But we are a divided nation when it comes to the issue of cheese:
