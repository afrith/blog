In August of this year Stats SA [released](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=18624)
data from Census 2022 at the level of police districts (precincts). With 1,167
police districts this is considerably more granular than the municipal-level
data that was previously available. That being said, it is nothing like the
ward-level data that was [previously promised](https://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=17580)
or the small area data available from Census 2011.

I've produced a collection of maps visualising some of the metrics from this
police-district data layer, which you can see below. Click each one for the
full-size image.
