title: New site - visualizing election results
---

I have [a new site up which graphically displays information about the results of the 2009 South African elections](http://afrith.github.io/election-web/). This project was an exercise in learning to use [the D3.js framework](http://d3js.org/). All the code and data is available in [a github repository](https://github.com/afrith/election-web).
