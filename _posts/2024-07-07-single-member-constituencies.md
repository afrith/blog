*Please note that I write here in my personal capacity. The views expressed

The 2024 election is behind us, but there is still discussion about
electoral reform following the introduction of independent candidates and the
separate regional ballot. Consequently I thought it would be interesting
to update my [imagined demarcation of single-member constituencies](https://x.com/adrianfrith/status/1279721244670210050)
for 2024.<!--more-->

I envisage such a demarcation as forming part of an overall mixed-member
proportional (MMP) electoral system. In such a system, the 200 members of the
National Assembly who are currently elected by proportional representation
based on each province's regional ballot, would instead be elected by
first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting in 200 constituencies. The other 200 members
elected from the national compensatory party lists would remain, so that the
overall composition of the National Assembly would still be proportional.

Below is the result of that process as an image. I have also created
[an interactive map](https://constmap.frith.dev/) where you can explore in more
detail. Tapping on a constituency on that map will show the name I gave it and
its election results based on the 2024 regional ballot.

## Demarcation process

I demarcated constituencies based on the certified voters roll from the 2021
local government elections. The logic behind this is that demarcation of
constituencies would have to be performed well before the general election, and
it seemed reasonable to base it on the roll used in the preceding local election.

I viewed it as absolutely necessary that constituencies not cross provincial
boundaries, so I first determined the number of seats for each province in
proportion to the size of the province's voters roll. I then determined a quota
of voters per constituency for each province. This gave the following results.

| Province | Registered voters | Constituencies | Quota |
| :------- | ----------------: | -------------: | ----: |
| Eastern Cape | 3,253,307 | 25 | 130,132 |
| Free State | 1,413,158 | 11 | 128,469 |
| Gauteng | 6,195,753 | 47 | 131,825 |
| KwaZulu-Natal | 5,447,815 | 41 | 132,874 |
| Limpopo | 2,585,080 | 20 | 129,254 |
| Mpumalanga | 1,903,239 | 14 | 135,946 |
| North West | 1,671,551 | 13 | 128,581 |
| Northern Cape | 622,746 | 5 | 124,549 |
| Western Cape | 3,111,930 | 24 | 129,664 |

I then demarcated each province separately based on these figures. In doing this
I allowed each constituency to vary from the provincial quota by no more than
15%.

I used the wards (as used for the 2021 local elections) as the basic building
block of the constituencies. I tried to adhere to municipal
boundaries as far as possible. I also tried to create reasonably coherent and
compact constituencies, and to avoid splitting communities.

I endeavoured not to bias or “gerrymander” the constituencies in favour of any
party. I didn't calculate the voting results for any of the constituencies until
I had completed the demarcation. Nonetheless, the demarcation process naturally
involves many judgment calls where unintentional bias may have slipped in.

## Election results

I used the regional ballot results from the 2024 general election to determine
which party would win each of my imagined constituencies. The results came out
as follows.

| Party | Vote share | Seats won |
| :---- | ---------: | --------: |
| ANC   |      39.3% |       117 |
| DA    |      21.8% |        48 |
| MK    |      14.1% |        30 |
| EFF   |       9.8% |         0 |
| IFP   |       4.3% |         5 |
| Others |     10.6% |         0 |  

The DA wins 21 seats in the Western Cape, 18 seats in Gauteng, and 9 seats in
mostly urban areas in the rest of the country.

The IFP wins 5 seats in its heartland of Zululand.

MK wins most of the rest of the seats in KwaZulu-Natal — 28 — leaving only
2 KZN constituencies for the ANC. MK also wins one seat in Mpumalanga, and one
in Gauteng. (This last seat in central Johannesburg sees its vote split six
ways between MK, ANC, EFF, DA, ActionSA and IFP, and the MK wins it with only
a 27% vote share.)

The ANC remains dominant in the rest of the country, taking all seats in the
Northern Cape, North West and Limpopo, and the vast majority of seats in the
Eastern Cape, Free State and Mpumalanga.

Notably the EFF doesn't win any seats in this demarcation despite having 9.8%
of the vote share. This reflects that the EFF's support base is not
geographically concentrated in any particular area. Combined with the 10.6%
of votes given to other parties that don't win a seat, over 20% of voters are
completely unrepresented by constituency MPs.

In 122 seats (61%) the winning party has an absolute majority with over 50% of
the votes cast. In the remaining 78 seats the winning party has less than 50%
of the vote — the lowest being the aforementioned Johannesburg Central
constituency won by MK with 27%. Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal are particularly
split, with 64% and 63% respectively of seats in those provinces being won
without an absolute majority.

## Conclusion

First-past-the-post elections in single-member constituencies produce
legislatures that are highly disproportionate to the votes cast. I would not
recommend the use of such an electoral system in a country like South Africa
with such a variety of parties.

However a mixed-member proportional system, combining directly-elected
constituency MPs with list MPs elected to restore proportionality, presents
an interesting option for electoral reform. This system is very similar to the
one already used to elect metropolitan and local councils. The existence of
a local constituency MP might bring more attention to voters' issues, increasing
accountability and the sense of connection between people and Parliament.
