title: 2014 election results map
---

The [detailed 2014 election results map](http://election2014.adrianfrith.com/) promised in [my last post](/interactive-election-map/) is live! It has all the features of the 2009 map, plus you can see the results from both the national and the provincial ballots. As before, you can zoom right down to street level and see the results for individual voting districts.

By way of example, [here you can see it with the provincial ballot results from my voting station](http://election2014.adrianfrith.com/#zoom=15&lat=-33.95543&lon=18.4749&ballot=prov&level=vd&sel=97090544).

The code, incidentally, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/afrith/election-map). The PostGIS database that backs it up can be [downloaded here](http://stuff.adrianfrith.com/election2014.sql.bz2), but be warned it is 700MB. Available for separate download are:

* [The election results by voting district](http://stuff.adrianfrith.com/2014-results.tar.gz)
* [Data to link voting districts to large areas](http://stuff.adrianfrith.com/sa-admin-data.tar.bz2)
* [The geography shapefiles](http://stuff.adrianfrith.com/sa-admin-boundaries.tar.bz2)
