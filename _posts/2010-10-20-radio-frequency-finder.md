Long ago, I used to have a website which listed the frequencies on which FM radio stations are broadcast from the various radio towers in the Cape Town area. That website died some years ago, but in the past I've had a couple of emails enquiring about it. Anyway, I recently discovered [FMSCAN](http://fmscan.org/), which allows you to select a location anywhere in the world and find out what radio stations you should be able to pick up there, and on what frequencies. So if you need that sort of information, now you know where to get it.
